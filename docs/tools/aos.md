# AOS (Aftersales Online System)

## 1. Title and Short Description

**AOS** (Aftersales Online System) is the official BMW Group web portal that provides independent operators, workshops, and third-party service providers with legal access to the technical information, service data, and programming services required to repair and maintain BMW Group vehicles.

## 2. Purpose / Use Cases

AOS is the primary gateway for non-authorized service providers to comply with EU regulations regarding access to vehicle repair and maintenance information (RMI).

*   **Technical Information:** Purchasing access to **AIR** (Aftersales Information Research) for repair instructions, wiring diagrams, and technical bulletins.
*   **Programming Access:** Purchasing time-based access to official programming services (similar to **ISTA/P** functionality) for flashing **ECU**s.
*   **Service Data:** Access to service history, maintenance schedules, and vehicle-specific data based on the **VIN** (Vehicle Identification Number).
*   **Tool Purchase:** Purchasing official service tools and equipment, including **ICOM** interfaces.

## 3. Supported Vehicle Generations

AOS provides information and services for all current and past BMW Group vehicles.

## 4. Interfaces & Protocols

AOS is a web-based portal.

*   **Web Access:** Accessed via a standard web browser.
*   **Security:** Requires secure login credentials and often uses two-factor authentication.

## 5. Installation & Access

AOS is a subscription-based service.

*   **System Requirements:** A modern computer with a stable internet connection.
*   **Legal Access:** Access is granted upon registration and purchase of a subscription (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly access).

## 6. General Workflow / Typical Procedures

1.  **Registration:** Independent operator registers on the AOS portal.
2.  **Purchase Access:** Operator purchases the required access time or subscription for the desired service (e.g., **AIR** access or programming session).
3.  **Service Execution:** The operator uses the purchased service (e.g., downloads a repair manual or initiates a remote programming session).

## 7. Key Screens / UI Elements

*   **Subscription Management:** Interface for purchasing and managing access time.
*   **Technical Information Search:** Gateway to the **AIR** database.
*   **Programming Interface:** Interface for initiating remote programming sessions.

## 8. Safety & Risks

The main risk is the cost associated with purchasing access time.

*   **Time Management:** Programming sessions are often time-critical and billed by the hour, requiring efficient workflow management.

## 9. Troubleshooting & Common Errors

| Error | Description | Diagnosis / Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login Failed** | Incorrect credentials or expired subscription. | Verify credentials and ensure the subscription is active. |
| **Programming Session Timeout** | The purchased programming time has expired. | Purchase additional programming time. |

## 10. Examples & Practical Notes

*   **Remote Programming:** AOS allows independent workshops to perform official **ECU** programming without owning the full **ISTA/P** setup, by using a pass-through device and the purchased time slot.
